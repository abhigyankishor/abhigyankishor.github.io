about me!

Hello fellow stranger! I am Abhigyan Kishor, a brown kid with a knack for coding... yeah suprising. But wait! There's more.

I am a First year enginnering student at Qatar University. I love to optmise anything I come across - be it improving sargability in database queries or using multi-threading to make a marching cubes algorithm. I am also a hobby graphic designer with loftier aspirations than talents, but I have gotten better at it (I think).

Check out some of my projects!

I'd like you to believe that I do come out of the man-cave from time to time. When I do, I like to bike around, swim and fly kites at the corniche. I used to play World of Tanks competitively and still run 2.6k wn8 easily. I am a wanderer at heart. I have visited the NAs, Middle East and India but I plan to go farther. 

Do you like what you see? Contact me!
